title: '$BUNT Launch Crowdfund'
---

The \$BUNT launch represents a sustainable approach to a coin launch, where platform fees generated during Season 1 are strategically allocated to build deep, sustainable liquidity for the $BUNT coin itself. This self-funding model demonstrates the platform's capabilities while creating a strong foundation for long-term success.

## The Sustainable Approach

### **Platform-First Strategy**
- **Proven Performance**: Majority of the platform fees until Season 1 airdrop depletion are dedicated to $BUNT's launch liquidity
- **Real Metrics**: Users can evaluate bunt.fun's actual performance, user base, and market share before our coin launch
- **Transparent Process**: Every fee collected contributes directly to the coin's launch liquidity pool
- **Community-Driven**: Platform success directly translates to stronger $BUNT launch conditions

### **Why This Matters**
- **Reduced Risk**: Investors have concrete data on platform performance before coin launch
- **Sustainable Growth**: A big portion of the liquidity is built organically through platform usage, not just external funding
- **Market Validation**: Strong platform metrics indicate genuine demand and utility
- **Long-term Alignment**: Platform success and coin success are inherently connected

## Liquidity Building Process

### **Fee Allocation Strategy**
- **100% Allocation**: Almost all platform fees go directly to $BUNT's liquidity pool
- **Automated Collection**: Platform fee wallets are labeled on Solscan to ensure transparent fee collection

### **Launch Preparation**
- **Pre-Launch Metrics**: We'll be announcing final platform performance summary before our coin launch
- **Market Readiness**: Assessment of launch conditions and market timing
- **Community Preparation**: Final communication and launch announcement strategy will be fully transparent prior to launch

## Benefits for Early Participants

## Long-term Vision
