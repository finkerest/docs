title: '$BUNT Launch Crowdfund'
---

The launch of \$BUNT is designed to be **sustainable and transparent**. Instead of hype-driven funding, we‚Äôre building liquidity from real platform usage. Fees generated during Season 1 are strategically allocated to bootstrap deep, lasting liquidity for \$BUNT ‚Äî creating a strong foundation for long-term success.

## üå± The Sustainable Approach

### Platform-First Strategy
- **Proven Performance**: Most platform fees (until Season 1 airdrop depletion) go directly into \$BUNT launch liquidity.  
- **Real Metrics**: Users see bunt.fun‚Äôs actual performance, user base, and market share before coin launch.  
- **Transparent Process**: Every fee contributes directly to the launch liquidity pool.  
- **Community-Driven**: Platform success = stronger conditions for the \$BUNT launch.  

### Why This Matters
- **Reduced Risk**: Investors can evaluate real platform data before launch.  
- **Sustainable Growth**: Liquidity is built organically from platform activity, not just external funding.  
- **Market Validation**: Usage metrics prove genuine demand and utility.  
- **Aligned Incentives**: Platform success and coin success go hand in hand.
