title: 'The $BUNT Flywheel'

How the \$BUNT ecosystem grows and rewards everyone.

<Note>
  These are proposed plans and will activate when \$BUNT officially launches.

## 🔄 What’s the Flywheel?

The \$BUNT flywheel is a **self-reinforcing loop**. Every action on bunt.fun (launches, trades, fees) helps strengthen the ecosystem, which in turn creates more value for holders, stakers, and builders.

Think of it like momentum: once it starts spinning, it only gets stronger.

## ⚙️ Core Components

### 1. Fee Generation
- Every coin launch and trade generates platform fees  
- More activity = more revenue  
- Future products will also contribute  

### 2. Buybacks & Burns
- Part of platform revenue buys \$BUNT on the open market  
- Tokens are burned → supply goes down, scarcity goes up  
- Consistent buy pressure helps support price  

### 3. Staking Rewards
- Stake \$BUNT to earn rewards from platform revenue  
- Compounding rewards encourage long-term holding  
- Reduces sell pressure and aligns incentives  

### 4. Ecosystem Growth
- Revenue funds new features and platform upgrades  
- More users attract more projects (and vice versa)  
- Creates a network effect where the ecosystem grows stronger over time

## 🚀 How It Works (Step by Step)

1. **Projects Launch** → Platform collects fees  
2. **Revenue Splits** → Buybacks, staking rewards, development  
3. **Buybacks & Rewards** → Support token price and give yield to stakers  
4. **Reinvestment** → Funds go back into growth + features  
5. **Growth Cycle** → Stronger ecosystem → more launches & trades

## 🎯 Benefits

### For Holders
- **Scarcity**: Buybacks + burns reduce supply  
- **Passive Yield**: Staking rewards add consistent income  
- **Utility Growth**: More features = more demand for \$BUNT  

### For Users
- **Better Tools**: Revenue funds platform upgrades  
- **Lower Costs**: Scale may reduce fees over time  
- **More Success**: Enhanced features = stronger project launches  

### For the Ecosystem
- **Sustainable Growth**: Self-funding and self-reinforcing  
- **Aligned Incentives**: Everyone benefits when activity grows  
- **Competitive Edge**: Flywheel creates momentum vs. competitors

## 🔮 What’s Next

The flywheel evolves as the platform scales:

- **Advanced Staking** → Multi-tier reward systems  
- **Governance** → Token holders shape platform direction  
- **Cross-Chain Expansion** → Support for multiple blockchains  
- **Partnerships** → Collaborations to grow the ecosystem
