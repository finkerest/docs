Buybacks help our coins. We've dedicated our fees to help out coins that matter.

Coins that our community loves. This is our way of showing love.

## How It Works

When you use the bunt.fun platform, a portion of the fees collected goes directly to buying back tokens from projects that have demonstrated strong community support and engagement. This creates a sustainable cycle where platform success directly benefits the tokens and communities we care about.

## Our Commitment

We believe in supporting the projects that matter most to our community. Through our buyback program, we're putting our money where our mouth is - investing in the future of the tokens that have earned the love and trust of our users.
