## 💰 Share Fees

> **Only for Tech & Fundraiser coins**

Share fees allow you to give all trading fees to a specific Twitter user. This creates a sustainable revenue stream for influencers, creators, or causes you want to support.

### How It Works
```
Every Trade → Trading Fees → Twitter User's Wallet on bunt.fun
```

**Requirements:**
- A valid existing Twitter Username (4-15 characters)

### Use Cases
- **Tech**: Partner with tech influencers to promote your project
- **Fundraiser**: Support charitable causes with ongoing donations

**🎯 Strategy**: Choose a Twitter user with an engaged following in your project's niche. This incentivizes them to promote your coin while creating a win-win partnership.

## 🔧 Developer Settings

### First Buy Amount
**What**: Automatically buys SOL worth of your coin when it launches

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Establishes initial price and market cap
- ✅ Creates immediate liquidity for trading
- ✅ Shows confidence in your project
- ✅ Prevents price manipulation at launch

**💡 Smart Launch**: A 0.5-2 SOL first buy creates a fair starting price and shows you believe in your project's potential.

### Burn Percentage
**What**: Burns a percentage of the coins from your first buy, permanently reducing supply

**Options**: 0% | 25% | 50% | 75% | 100%

**Strategy:**
- **0%**: Keep all coins, no deflation
- **25-50%**: Moderate deflation, good for most projects
- **75-100%**: High scarcity, creates FOMO

**🔥 Burn Benefits**: Reduces total supply, making remaining tokens more valuable over time.
