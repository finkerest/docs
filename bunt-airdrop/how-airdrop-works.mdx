### 🪙 Staking Rewards  
- Stake verified BUNT coins at [bunt.fun/stake](https://bunt.fun/stake) → **Exponential $BUNT airdrop rewards**  

**How Liquid Staking Works**:  
- Register your wallet address that holds verified BUNT coins  
- Keep your coins in your wallet while earning staking rewards  
- Staking period: **7 days minimum**  
- If you sell or move coins below staking amount → stake cancels before 7 days  
- Complete/claim rewards after 7 days of staking  

**Tips**:  
- Hold verified BUNT coins for maximum staking rewards  
- Don't move or sell staked coins during the 7-day period  
- Combine staking with trading and creating for maximum $BUNT earnings
